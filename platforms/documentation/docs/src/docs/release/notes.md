`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 8.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_8.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes, and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

### FILL-IN-KEY-AREA improvements

<<<FILL IN CONTEXT FOR KEY AREA>>>
Example:
> The [configuration cache](userguide/configuration_cache.html) improves build performance by caching the result of
> the configuration phase. Using the configuration cache, Gradle can skip the configuration phase entirely when
> nothing that affects the build configuration has changed.

#### FILL-IN-FEATURE
> HIGHLIGHT the use case or existing problem the feature solves
> EXPLAIN how the new release addresses that problem or use case
> PROVIDE a screenshot or snippet illustrating the new feature, if applicable
> LINK to the full documentation for more details

<a name="project-layout"></a>
### Project Layout improvement

The [`ProjectLayout`](org/gradle/api/file/ProjectLayout.html) class is used to access various directories and files within a project. 
In this version of Gradle it gets the ability to also access the settings directory of the build (where the settings file is located).
While this is a non-project specific location, there are uses cases where projects need to be aware of it and resolve file paths relative to it.
See [`ProjectLayout.getSettingsDirectory()`](org/gradle/api/file/ProjectLayout.html#getSettingsDirectory()).
