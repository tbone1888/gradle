        Please follow the instructions below.
        We receive dozens of issues every week, so to stay productive, we will close issues that don't provide enough information.

        If you need help with Gradle or have a usage question, please reach [our community](http://help.gradle.org/) instead of creating an issue.

        Please open Android-related issues on [the Android Issue Tracker](https://source.android.com/source/report-bugs)
        Please open IntelliJ-related issues on [the JetBrains Issue Tracker](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/newIssue?project=IDEA)
        Please open Gradle Native-related issues on [the Gradle Native repository](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-native/issues)

        Provide a brief summary of the issue in the title above

        Provide a [minimal, self-contained example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_reproducible_example) project demonstrating the problem as a GitHub repository or an attached archive.
        You can use [the template](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-issue-reproducer) with a Gradle GitHub action set up to showcase your problem.
        In the rare cases where this is infeasible, we will also accept a detailed set of instructions.
        You can also use [Gradle Project Replicator](https://github.com/android/project-replicator) to reproduce the structure of your project.
